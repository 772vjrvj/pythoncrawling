          "text": "Innovative design and fun to drive. Achieved over 300 mile range on open highway. Saw slight decrease in range in the New England winter. Though similar to my gas guzzling SUV. Since I have Tesla solar panels and backup batteries, my fuel cost for my EV have been near zero when charging at home. \nThere has been a learning curve. Especially as I switch between gas and EV. Sometimes I forget I am driving the Tesla when accelerating/merging on a highway. \nOverall, I will buy another Tesla. ",

However thereâ€™s an annoying creaking noise from the screen on less than smooth roads that is difficult to isolate where exactly itâ€™s coming from but is it worth having Tesla take time to look into it ? Also the front suspension feels like something is moving when Iâ€™m reversing out of my driveway and having the front wheels turned .Cabin noise can be very annoying on less then smooth roads, something that is slowly being addressed with the current model . Greatest car on smooth roads which are extremely difficult to find.",

          "title": "Best Car I have ever owned !",
          "text": "This is my first EV and the experience and it has been fantastic. The car is a Long Range Model Y Tesla All Wheel Drive. The acceleration is insane and the power is too. I installed a home charger and so far I am averaging 259 wh/mi with the car. My wife and I purchased the car in June of 2023 and we have taken several trips in the car during this summer. So far my average power used is 259 wh/mi; is the same as getting 130 MPGe. Tesla's Super Charging network is great every time we have taken a trip, it only takes about 15 minutes to gain about 175 miles at a Tesla Super Charger. My cost to operate is currently less than four cents per mile. The interior of the car is spartan but once you get used to it you realize that you don't need all those buttons like all the other cars have. We purchased a white car with white seats and so far they are very easy to keep clean. I don't understand why anyone would buy an EV unless it has the North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug. From my understanding most all auto manufactures are converting over to this standard so trying to find a working charger should get much better. The experience of buying a car with Tesla was the best automobile purchase I have ever made. There was no pressure, if you want the car that's great if not that's OK too. Although the car does not have satellite radio I don't miss it because I never used it any way. I did subscribe to the premium connectivity and it allows you to watch videos and connect to almost any app. The OTA software updates are included with the car (you don't need premium connectivity to receive them) and that means that you never need to visit the dealer to update software. Tesla actually came to my home right after I bought the car and flashed a couple of access cards that quit working right after I bought the car. The battery pack and drive units in the car has a 120,000 or eight year warranty and the rest of the car has a five year 50,000 mile warranty. Voice commands using the right scroll wheel on the steering wheel will allow you to do almost anything you need to do without using the touch screen if you like. I didn't pay for the full self driving package but I do enjoy using the beta package on the car. I suppose that the best feature is the phone app that unlocks and locks the car without you ever having to do anything. The app allows you to control the charging rate of the car at home, you can set it fast or slow. The map app in the car will show you where the charging stations are at and will map out where you can charge if you want it too. ",

          "text": "I live in a rural area. I mostly drive two lane state and federal highways. Recently we took the vehicle in a road trip. There was a critical non Tesla charger on the trip. That charger was reported down. Luckily it was actually working. Otherwise we carry a charger cable with RV parks 30 and 50 amp connectors.\n\nDriving these two lane highways the speed limits are wrong on the nav screen most of the time. In one case the speed limit was forty miles an hour different. The reason I believe is previous long term construction zone speeds were not returned to normal.\n\nI haven't attempted to make a bug report in weeks. I tried to report the speed limit problem again yesterday. The car went to the bug report music as punishment immediately. Tesla does not want any feedback from customers. It a very arrogant company.\n\nThe problem with the speed limits being off is the self driving and autopilot won't work correctly.\n\nIf you are using it as a commuter or driving the interstate this is an awesome car. The charging infrastructure out west is not built up out of cities and away from interstates The cars shows 310 miles range. At highway speeds you're looking at around 240 miles.\n\nIn Utah I 70 speeds are 80 mph. We pulled into the Tesla charger at Green River. The temperature was in the 90's. People at the chargers were experiencing battery anomalies. The batteries were overheated. The batteries stopped charging before achieving full.\n\nIt's a great city car. \n",

          "text": "I bought Tesla Model Y last month. The overall experience of the car is not great. Donâ€™t make your decision based on price cuts.Here are the things I noticed.\n\nPros\n- Good acceleration you will notice.\n\nCons\n- Panel gap issues which cannot be fixed and door closing issues which are not addressed.\n- Battery range is Joke. I leave in Pennsylvania there will be 50-60 miles degradation for the number of miles you charged.\n- Cheap Interiors.\n- Road noise is very high. May be it is designed just for internal roads. \n- Door designed is not great which contributes to road noise.\n- Need to have efficient blind spot monitoring than just cameras which are not great.\n- Poor auto wipers usage. I cannot change speed when I have to use it suddenly. May be they have to move wipers system out of screen.\n- The trunk is bigger but the way they designed the door is horrible. They compromised too much space because of style.  As a user I donâ€™t want that much huge door. \n- The back mirrors are not that convinent because of trunk door design.\n- I got peed myself while using auto steer beta option. It dropped the speed from 75 miles to 45 miles while changing lanes. Thank god I donâ€™t have any vehicles behind. If there was truck then I will be gone for sure. I change my Mind using any of Drive options which left me with just regular battery car.\n\nFor just buying battery car we have very good options coming along in luxury vehicles. I donâ€™t have to buy Tesla for it as any of auto drive options are not usable with confidence. \n\nOverall very bad experience with the vehicle.\n",

          "text": "So I finally decided to buy EV, and went with Tesla, since it had being around for a while, price is good, network is large, etc Decided to do 48 hours demo drive. My local dealer was not able to  give it to me for 48hours, but told me to get it late on Saturday, they closed on Monday, so I could drop it early on Monday. So I picked up Model Y. I live about 40 min away from the dealer. In about 20 min after pick up Ive noticed that map started gradually disappearing, until just a red triangle was left (my area has pretty good cell coverage). Ok, I decided I will restart this car later on so GPS will reappear. Did not do it that night though. Left car on my driveway with 47% charge (down from 51 in 40 min, I guess its ok). Early in the morning I started this car and saw that battery charge dropped to 42 overnight. Well, I guess something was draining its battery pretty good., considering auto climate and cameras security were off. Than I was very surprised to see that none of the cameras \"were available\". Park assist, turn, inside.... Just a blank space with the car picture on its monitor. Did resets, cameras re-calibrations, etc whatever else I could find on internet, nothing helped.\nI did not contact support, since I was bringing this car back to dealer, did not want to get involved even more. The bottom line, I truly believed that in this many years of Tesla existence, such software (?) glitches make this vehicle unreliable. ",

          "text": "In March of 2024, we were deciding between the Ford Mach E and the Tesla Model Y. Tesla began offering aggressive lease rates that Ford only matched about 30 days after I signed my Tesla lease.  It was about that time I began regretting our choice.  The biggest and most egregious issue is the lack of service centers. I live in metro Detroit and the only option for service is 45 minutes away in Clarkston. On top of that, they are scheduled months out for service visits.  As far as the vehicle itself, here are the issues: 1) Software - the interface is not user friendly, glitches fairly regularly, and updates with unpredictable regularity and results. 2) The roofline comes down aggressively close to the driver's head. I have a tall upper body and it creates a claustrophobic effect. 3) The climate vents are immobile, unlike nearly every other vehicle. 4) The lack of a dash display in favor of only having the giant tablet display in the center is uncomfortable. 5) This last one is a minor, but annoying, quirk. When everything else on the vehicle is automatic, why on earth is the \"frunk\" (blech marketing on that one - ew) not automatic close? It isn't all bad.  Here are the positives: 1) Quality construction - I have heard people complain about lack of quality with Tesla, but I don't get that.  Aside from a failure with the automatic seat latch and the software, I have found the Model Y to both feel and operate in a solid and stable fashion. 2) As with other electric vehicles, the immediate torque is both useful and exhilarating.  This thing moves and handles with precision and speed. 3) The sound system is terrific.  All told, the more time passes, the less I like the vehicle.  In 2.5 years, I don't expect to be leasing another Tesla.",

For me, doing mostly local driving with a few trips here and there over 100 miles, decided to go with the RWD + FSD. First off, the car looks and drives great! Quick enough, quiet, comfortable, all-in-all extremely happy. The purchase process through the app was simple, and only had to sign a couple papers when I showed up to take delivery the next day. I also decided to try out Tesla Insurance which is fun to kind of watch your safety score change and actually ended up being cheaper than my equivalent policy with Progressive that I have had for many many years. I personally like the minimalistic interior with one central screen. The ONLY con I would have to say is the wood trim, just kind of feels out of place. I did delete all the wood with aftermarket carbon fiber so looks much better. If this experience holds out for the next 3 years or so and the resale value holds, I could see myself continuing to buy Tesla's. ",

In fact when I go to Pechanga I will fully charge at the 76 station with Tesla Superchargers then use the EV chargers at the casino.

          "text": "Suckered by the hype, I leased a Tesla Model Y and it was a nightmare experience: Trashy ride quality â€” rides like it has no shocks; range is a lie â€” got 110 miles in winter, 180 miles in summer with HVAC use. Slightly better on highways at 220 miles but still far short of the 300+ miles claimed. 12V battery failed with no warning, and it took Tesla TWO weeks to dispatch someone to replace it. Unlike most cars, the hood is not manual and when the battery dies, you have to Jerry rig it open but in my case, Tesla failed to properly wire the batteries at the factory so they had to drill holes to get it to open. Then the HVAC failed followed by the trunk strut failing; Wiring harness fired. In all, I spent over $3000 in car rentals while Tesla got around to repairing the various problems. Dumped it and got the Lexus RZ 450e and am getting 275 miles to 400 miles range in city driving. The ride quality, tech and safety features of the Lexus blow away the Model Y. Took it on a road trip from DC to NYC and it beat the Tesla in range and efficiency. Could even charge it a Tesla Supercharger. Lexus is offering huge discounts on the RZ (got mine for $43,000) and its the best EV on the market. Disregard the critics, just drive one after you drive a Model Y and youâ€™ll see how far behind Tesla has fallen Lexus in EVs. My second favorite was the Cadillac Lyriq but it makes an annoying pedestrian warning sound at speeds below 25 MPH which kills the silent EV experience. Check out my full review of the Lexus RZ 450e on Edmunds (posted under my handle: RZ 450e in DC)",

          "text": "Iâ€™ve had my 2023 MYLR for 14 months now and put almost 18k miles. I do have a wall mounted charger and do charge predominantly at home. My overall electricity costs are $750 for those 18k miles. The ride is an 8.5/10 as you do feel a little more than most cars in that price range due to the higher tire pressure requirements. Keeping the vegan leather clean does require a little elbow grease, but not that tough. I do wish Tesla and Apple could come together and mend any differences they might have. I do miss my Apple Car Play. One other gripe is if all the technology is in the car and will be maintained at every software update, why would some need to pay $12k for the FSD feature. Itâ€™s an easy money grab for Tesla those that buy it. \nOverall, love my decision on my purchase. I did look at other EVâ€™s but the technology and charging network were the biggest things when I finally came down to deciding. \nIf I was a designer, I would look to improve the front nose section as it is a massive bug collector. Second thing is, why not mold the frunk, or under trunk storage to at least hold a donut spare. That is a huge miss in my opinion. Design one that existing owners like me could swap out to allow me to carry a spare. ",

Very convenient to just get in the car, click drive and go.  No maintaince needed so far and I'm at 20k miles. The tires have not been rotated, but I have been watching the wear and they have worn very evenly. With regenerative braking standard, I'm not expected to have to do any brake maintenance until well after 100K miles. The car has exceeded my expectations in so many ways.  Supercharges are all along the east coast and I have never had an issue finding one or using one. The whole charging experience is very simple.",

Whether it's commuting through city traffic or embarking on a road trip, the Model Y's comfort and versatility make every journey enjoyable for both me and my passengers.\n\nWhat truly sets the Model Y apart is its performance. The instant acceleration and responsive handling redefine the driving experience. Navigating tight corners or accelerating onto highways is effortless and exhilarating, all while maintaining a quiet and smooth ride. The touchscreen interface is intuitive and keeps improving with each software update, while features like Autopilot provide added peace of mind and convenience.\n\nCharging the Model Y is surprisingly convenient, especially with Tesla's Supercharger network and the ability to charge at home using the Tesla Wall Connector. Range anxiety is minimal, allowing me to explore without worrying about where the next charge will be. Overall, the Tesla Model Y has exceeded my expectations in every way, offering a blend of luxury, technology, and sustainability that has made it my favorite car I've ever owned.\n",

I sacrificed a little bit of additional range and went with the performance over the other models. I really love the wheels, red calibers, carbon fiber, accents, and the stance of that vehicle!",
