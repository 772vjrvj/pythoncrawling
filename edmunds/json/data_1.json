          "text": "I am quite happy with my brand new 2024 Model Y dual motor long-range. For me, the technology is stunning, The ride is good, great steering, and very fast when needed. The seating position is quite nice, tons of storage space, awesome sound system, super smooth and quiet, And of course all the benefits of a BEV with the supercharger network! We got the upgrade interior in white which is a nice offset to the dark gray exterior. One pedal driving is really great once you get used to it. And of course you have built-in internet connection, so you can stream videos while you're charging. Preconditioning the interior and the battery before you drive is such a good feature. We also use dog mode extensively as we have a little dog that loves to travel with us. I like the undistracting minimalist interior, I really like the capabilities of the phone app and using it as a key. You just walk up, sit down and drive away! I realized that it's going to take a little bit longer to do longer drives, but i'm willing to accept that and have great confidence with the supercharger network. Fit and finish on the 2924 is quite good and so far no problems at all. Yes, there are some limitations technologically, like no Apple Carplay or Android Auto, but I'm willing to deal with those limitations and adapt to Tesla's approach. The buying experience was super easy without the dealer upsell issues. Overall 5 stars!",          "thumbsUp": 13,

          "text": "The Tesla Model Y is good at so many things.  Quiet and calm when you want but still faster than sports cars.  Great for people who love tech but simple to do all the basics.  Huge amount of storage when you include frunk, sub-trunk and trunk side compartments.  App control is so nice - pre-heat or pre-cool, send nav directions trough app, view car cameras and honk horn remotely.  Dog-mode is a brilliant feature.  Autopilot in traffic is such a stress reducer!  Software so good that I don't want car play or android auto.  Love watching YouTube or Netflix when I have time to kill.  Best stereo I've ever had.  Nice to listen to text messages and respond through dictation.  Syncs with calendar so knows nav when I get in the car.  Reliable supercharging offers peace of mind with no range anxiety.  Just an incredible car - amazed I can afford something this good!",

          "text": "This is an updated review. I had an issue that got resolved, so just iterating that the car is exceptional. The software runs better than any other EV (or non-EV) I drove. The battery management is great, and we see no degradation two years in.\nIt is always funny to see sports cars trying to accelerate faster out of a light. The Y performance is untouchable, and I am guessing the S plaid is insane.\nHaving sentry mode is great, especially when paring in tight spots, or sketchy places.\nWe had some misaligned doors when first getting the car, so there was some wind noise, they fixed that quickly.\nThe (no) maintenance costs are fantastic. Even the brakes will last longer since the car slows down and charges the battery when you take your foot of the accelerator, there are days I'd drive without touching the brakes once.\nRemember that you are driving a very quiet vehicle, and pedestrians may not hear you, though people are getting used to be more vigilant in our area with lots of EVs.\nLots of new EV options now, but the user experience in the Tesla seems quite superior to me, comparing to Ford, Mercedes, and Kia.\n",

          "text": "I have the 2024 awd long range model in ultra red.  I've noticed that some people complain about having to take your eyes off of the road to start the wipers.  This is not true.    Quickly tap the button on the left stick once and then within a few seconds move the left control button on the steering wheel left or right to speed up the wipers.  Alternatively, hold down the right button on the wheel and say \"wipers on level 3\" or whatever level you want.  You can also get CarPlay if you want it by buying a wireless CarPlay adapter on Amazon for less than $100 so CarPlay is available if you want it.\n     The interior is a little more Spartan than I would like but everything else I like.  For long road trips charge the car to 100% and you will get around 300 miles range but I never drive that far without stopping and, like a gas car, wouldn't let the battery go to close to 0.",

Forget about backing up unless you want to risk a collision or hitting a pedestrian.

          "text": "What I didn’t know:  The paint is soft, as in, so soft that if you take it through a car wash - even with soft scrubbers - you will have swirl marks in the paint.  Additionally, the paint will chip away with every rock that touches the car.  Very noticeable if you get a color paint.  The seats are very uncomfortable.  May have been designed by engineers who have severe head-forward posture and are unable to recognize how uncomfortable the seats are for those with normal posture.  Suspension is so stiff and the headrests are so uncomfortable that on any uneven surface (any road not freshly paved), the headrest will hit your head with force.  The “automatic” wipers are anything but.  That should not have been a tough bar to cross, as most companies have been successfully making automatic wipers for decades.  The interior is cheap, and marks up/frays quickly.  Essentially, it’s the car you get when engineers who don’t know how to design cars or how to properly drive cars are given free rein.  The Autopilot/FSD software drives like a bad 16-year old driver who didn’t take a driving class.  The Hyundai Ioniq 5 is a much better choice value-wise for what you’ll spend on a Tesla.  I will say, the charging network is good.",

Being a 60 something, 6 foot tall driver, no physical restrictions, I was getting tired of climbing in and out of my sedan and really was looking forward to graduating to something a little higher off the ground without the usual antics getting in and out of a car. A by chance test drive of this Y had me sold in literally 30 minutes. Slid right into the seat, amazed at the headroom. The acceleration off a dead start is nothing short of amazing, as is the sustained, quick ramp up to cruising speed. Sleeky good looking SUV, ample front and rear passenger space for 5 passengers, roomy hatchback trunk with a frunk to boot. A barebone front dash with just a control monitor takes some getting used to but you get used to it. Haven't rolled into a gas station in a year, charge at home and super charge on the road. Knocked one star off for the trunk fitment which need an adjustment. It was fine for awhile but seems to have regressed, not a biggie but build quality in this regard could be better. Other than that, reliable thus far and oh forgot to mention, the maintenance is next to none, just a tire rotation and air filter change.  ",

That charger was reported down. Luckily it was actually working. Otherwise we carry a charger cable with RV parks 30 and 50 amp connectors.\n\nDriving these two lane highways the speed limits are wrong on the nav screen most of the time. In one case the speed limit was forty miles an hour different. The reason I believe is previous long term construction zone speeds were not returned to normal.\n\nI haven't attempted to make a bug report in weeks. I tried to report the speed limit problem again yesterday. The car went to the bug report music as punishment immediately. Tesla does not want any feedback from customers. It a very arrogant company.\n\nThe problem with the speed limits being off is the self driving and autopilot won't work correctly.\n\nIf you are using it as a commuter or driving the interstate this is an awesome car. The charging infrastructure out west is not built up out of cities and away from interstates The cars shows 310 miles range. At highway speeds you're looking at around 240 miles.\n\nIn Utah I 70 speeds are 80 mph. We pulled into the Tesla charger at Green River. The temperature was in the 90's. People at the chargers were experiencing battery anomalies. The batteries were overheated. The batteries stopped charging before achieving full.\n\nIt's a great city car. \n",

My local dealer was not able to  give it to me for 48hours, but told me to get it late on Saturday, they closed on Monday, so I could drop it early on Monday. So I picked up Model Y. I live about 40 min away from the dealer. In about 20 min after pick up Ive noticed that map started gradually disappearing, until just a red triangle was left (my area has pretty good cell coverage). Ok, I decided I will restart this car later on so GPS will reappear. Did not do it that night though. Left car on my driveway with 47% charge (down from 51 in 40 min, I guess its ok). Early in the morning I started this car and saw that battery charge dropped to 42 overnight. Well, I guess something was draining its battery pretty good., considering auto climate and cameras security were off. Than I was very surprised to see that none of the cameras \"were available\". Park assist, turn, inside.... Just a blank space with the car picture on its monitor. Did resets, cameras re-calibrations, etc whatever else I could find on internet, nothing helped.\nI did not contact support, since I was bringing this car back to dealer, did not want to get involved even more. The bottom line, I truly believed that in this many years of Tesla existence, such software (?) glitches make this vehicle unreliable. ",

          "text": "In March of 2024, we were deciding between the Ford Mach E and the Tesla Model Y. Tesla began offering aggressive lease rates that Ford only matched about 30 days after I signed my Tesla lease.  It was about that time I began regretting our choice.  The biggest and most egregious issue is the lack of service centers. I live in metro Detroit and the only option for service is 45 minutes away in Clarkston. On top of that, they are scheduled months out for service visits.  As far as the vehicle itself, here are the issues: 1) Software - the interface is not user friendly, glitches fairly regularly, and updates with unpredictable regularity and results. 2) The roofline comes down aggressively close to the driver's head. I have a tall upper body and it creates a claustrophobic effect. 3) The climate vents are immobile, unlike nearly every other vehicle. 4) The lack of a dash display in favor of only having the giant tablet display in the center is uncomfortable. 5) This last one is a minor, but annoying, quirk. When everything else on the vehicle is automatic, why on earth is the \"frunk\" (blech marketing on that one - ew) not automatic close? It isn't all bad.  Here are the positives: 1) Quality construction - I have heard people complain about lack of quality with Tesla, but I don't get that.  Aside from a failure with the automatic seat latch and the software, I have found the Model Y to both feel and operate in a solid and stable fashion. 2) As with other electric vehicles, the immediate torque is both useful and exhilarating.  This thing moves and handles with precision and speed. 3) The sound system is terrific.  All told, the more time passes, the less I like the vehicle.  In 2.5 years, I don't expect to be leasing another Tesla.",

For me, doing mostly local driving with a few trips here and there over 100 miles, decided to go with the RWD + FSD. First off, the car looks and drives great! Quick enough, quiet, comfortable, all-in-all extremely happy. The purchase process through the app was simple, and only had to sign a couple papers when I showed up to take delivery the next day. I also decided to try out Tesla Insurance which is fun to kind of watch your safety score change and actually ended up being cheaper than my equivalent policy with Progressive that I have had for many many years. I personally like the minimalistic interior with one central screen. The ONLY con I would have to say is the wood trim, just kind of feels out of place. I did delete all the wood with aftermarket carbon fiber so looks much better. If this experience holds out for the next 3 years or so and the resale value holds, I could see myself continuing to buy Tesla's. ",

Slightly better on highways at 220 miles but still far short of the 300+ miles claimed. 12V battery failed with no warning, and it took Tesla TWO weeks to dispatch someone to replace it. Unlike most cars, the hood is not manual and when the battery dies, you have to Jerry rig it open but in my case, Tesla failed to properly wire the batteries at the factory so they had to drill holes to get it to open. Then the HVAC failed followed by the trunk strut failing; Wiring harness fired. In all, I spent over $3000 in car rentals while Tesla got around to repairing the various problems. Dumped it and got the Lexus RZ 450e and am getting 275 miles to 400 miles range in city driving. The ride quality, tech and safety features of the Lexus blow away the Model Y. Took it on a road trip from DC to NYC and it beat the Tesla in range and efficiency. Could even charge it a Tesla Supercharger. Lexus is offering huge discounts on the RZ (got mine for $43,000) and its the best EV on the market. Disregard the critics, just drive one after you drive a Model Y and you’ll see how far behind Tesla has fallen Lexus in EVs. My second favorite was the Cadillac Lyriq but it makes an annoying pedestrian warning sound at speeds below 25 MPH which kills the silent EV experience. Check out my full review of the Lexus RZ 450e on Edmunds (posted under my handle: RZ 450e in DC)",

          "text": "I just bought the car a month ago. My experience with the Tesla Model Y has been deeply disappointing due to critical safety issues encountered in cold weather. \n\nWhen the temperature dropped to 18 degrees Fahrenheit, my car's cameras completely froze, rendering the navigation system useless and making it extremely dangerous to back up – a significant concern given the vehicle's size and limited visibility. This lack of functionality creates a serious safety hazard. \n\nI contacted Tesla immediately and was told to simply schedule a service appointment, the earliest of which is three weeks out. This is unacceptable for such a serious issue. \n\nWhile I appreciate the technological advancements of the Model Y, its inability to function safely in cold weather is a major flaw that needs immediate attention. Additionally, I cannot back up safely since the back is so bulky, and the visibility is nearly 0 ... They do not have standard apps like Apple Connect. \n\nI will try to sell this car. The Billionaire does not care about little things like this that happen to his customers.   \n| ",

I’ve gotten to talk to the reps a lot because like 5 times I’ve had problems and I’m in the shop all the time. I think Elon has vision and wants to make amazing products using the best tech but his employees are letting him and us customers down. ",
